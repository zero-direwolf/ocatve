    Make run.sh executable with: $chmod +x ./run.sh
    Run ./run.sh -c -H20 -m0 -M mind/boot. Global variables will be set and run.py will launch.
    If $MINDDIR/conf/commands.json has changed and your machine is online, a new dictionary and language model will be created via the Sphinx Knowledge Base Tool.
    Say Launch Open Assistant to enable operating system control commands such as Maximize Window and Fullscreen. Say Launch Stella to initiate a dialogue with her mind. To have Stella quit say Goodbye Stella. Say Close Open Assistant to quit operating system command recognition.
    To change assistant commands and language, edit conf/commands.json. Exit and relaunch run.sh.
